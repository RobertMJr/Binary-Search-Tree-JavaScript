## Description
A binary tree is a type of data structure for storing data such as numbers in an organized way.

### [Binary Search Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree)
    In computer science, a binary search tree (BST), also called an ordered or sorted binary tree, is a rooted binary tree whose internal nodes each store a key greater than all the keys in the node's left subtree and less than those in its right subtree.

    The order of nodes in a BST means that each comparison skips about half of the remaining tree, so the whole lookup takes time proportional to the binary logarithm of the number of items stored in the tree.
